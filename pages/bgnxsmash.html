        <p> 
            Each month at SFU Surrey, we gather to play Board Games and Smash Melee and Ultimate. 
            Food, drinks and games are all provided, but feel free to bring your own! 
            Each alternating month we switch hosts between MSESS and SSSS, and we love to collaborate with other SFU clubs,
            such as the Surrey Campus Committee or SFU Dank Memes Gang.
