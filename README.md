## Structure 

We are developing on a blended Bootstrap 4.4.1 and Custom SCSS Styling, 
based on minimalism, with an emphasise on using Bootstrap for structure and Custom SCSS for color and animation. 

All custom SCSS is linked into the main.scss file, which is compiled into one main.css file. 

There is little to no js other than files required by Bootstrap, including jQuery 3.5.0

## SCSS 
Run the command sass main.scss main.css
