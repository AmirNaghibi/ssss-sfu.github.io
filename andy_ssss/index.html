                    We believe learning should be fun, and fun should be a chance to learn. 
                    We believe in simple solutions done with care and thought, and that expectations are meant to be exceeded. 
                    <br><br>
                    We accomplish this belief through focused, organized events, broad and sincere outreach, and always having a great time together.
                    <br><br>
                    This is how our team of 10 Execs, along with our student body of 200+ students,
                    host one of BC's largest independent beginner oriented hackathons, and participates daily in student events and affairs at SFU.
